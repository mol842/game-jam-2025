# UNRESOLVED [CO]DEPENDENCY
## A space dating sim that never should have happened...

Made by Eleanor and Molly (M and E) for the Unimelb Cissa x GMC Game Jam March 2025
Theme: A World without Humans...
Team Name: anemone

Art, story, dialogue, characters, worldbuilding, heart and soul crafted lovingly by Eleanor Nguyen
Cursed React js programming by Molly Stow

We signed up for this at like 2pm on Friday. 
If you told me last week that I would spend my weekend coding a dating simulator I honestly would not have believed you.

If anyone actually finishes this... PLEASE LET US KNOW!!!
(The story is actually completeable!)
